$ ps -e -o pid,ppid,command
//pid_t - 2byte value

EXEC - 
Functions that contain the letter p in their names ( execvp and execlp ) accept a
program name and search for a program by that name in the current execution
path; functions that don’t contain the p must be given the full path of the pro-
gram to be executed.

Functions that contain the letter v in their names ( execv , execvp , and execve )
accept the argument list for the new program as a NULL-terminated array of
pointers to strings. Functions that contain the letter l ( execl , execlp , and
execle ) accept the argument list using the C language’s varargs mechanism.
Functions that contain the letter e in their names ( execve and execle ) accept an
additional argument, an array of environment variables.The argument should be
a NULL-terminated array of pointers to character strings. Each character string
should be of the form “ VARIABLE=value ”.

Process scheduling - 
$ nice -n 10 sort input.txt > output.txt

A higher niceness value means that the process is given a lesser execution priority;
a process with a lower (that is, negative) niceness gets more execution time.

We can use the "renice" command to change the niceness of a running process from
the command line.
